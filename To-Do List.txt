To-Do List:

- Move database-related operations to ProduceFunctionsClass.py
	* edit produce
	* add one (needs to be integrated into add in general once that is set up)
- Reformat help to something more readable
- Better way to deal with duplicate fridge entries (add command)
- Get data of specified produce to add it to fridge
