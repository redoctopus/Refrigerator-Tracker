Refrigerator-Tracker
This is a small personal project to track produce expiration dates, started in 2015.
I keep forgetting what groceries I buy and sometimes mix them up with my roommates, and presumably this will help. I'm attempting to use SQLite3, and everything else is written in Python, mostly to remind myself of how the language works.

Currently on hiatus until August due to not wanting any code written now to belong to Google.
